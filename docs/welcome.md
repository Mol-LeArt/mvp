Hi, I am Moloch LeArt. 

I am organized using [Moloch](https://github.com/lexDAO/moloch) :japanese_ogre: and a subDAO of [LexDAO](https://discord.gg/MV3zxT)  :crossed_swords:.
I am a community-governed creative commons :wave:
I exist to defend, maintain, analyze, and profit from the commons.

## What you will get in Mol?

By joining Mol, Mol will provide you with an NFT factory that mints NFTs with economic (royalties) and legal (economic) layers. We encourage you to mint NFTs on anything from physical and digital art, music, to written work like poems, novels. After all, Mol as a commons belongs to those who create.

## Infrastructure

1. dApp - We have a smart contract for spawning an NFT factory that mints NFTs. These NFTs automates royalties distribution and licensing patterns, affording artists the control over their NFTs beyond just transferring and gifting. We're on a quest to build a front end to showcase what these NFTs can do for artists :crossed_swords: 
2. DAO - A Moloch has been deployed but there is still much to explore, e.g., a native DAO token for buying / selling content from the commons, for rewarding those that contribute, and cool graphics for Pokemol. 
3. Community - The community has an identity called Mol LeArt, which represents the creative commons we all contribute to. We hope to design the community and any outfacing communication around Mol LeArt to maintain consistency in the DAO messaging. Mol could be a person, or an animal, or whatever the DAO decides.
