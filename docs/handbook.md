Mol LeArt is a DAO managed creative commons, and its purpose is to defend, maintain, analyze, and profit from the commons.

## Motivation
Humans are creative creatures. We use our brains to dream up fantastical and impossible things. Artists bring these things to life. This looks like paintings, music, writing, and more. Many of our favorite stories and memories are because of art. We love these things so much we’re willing to pay for them, sometimes at tremendous valuations.

The problem is, when art gets resold at higher and higher multiples the artists don’t get a piece of those profits. As a result, the phrase “starving artist” is a stereotype that is often associated with creatives. It’s very hard to make any money creating art! It doesn’t have to be this way.

With LexArt, an NFT token standard that Mol uses, artist can create content, tokenize it, and that token contract will enforce revenue sharing of secondary sales with the artist. Now artists can get the full value of their art vs just the first price someone is willing to buy it at. LexArt puts the power back in the hands of the artists.

## Governance
Note: Mol's governance will be limited to members with the Builders role until further notice. This is to minimize noise for voting on proposals and focus on building infrastructure for Mol.

Mol is organized using Moloch v2.

## Roles
**Artists**
Each member gets a factory by default to mint whatever she wants, except for expressions not protected under freedom of speech. Any new factory request requires members to submit a proposal for voting. 

Each mint rewards governance token, up to a monthly cap of 100 shares. Some options to calculating exchange rate could be:
- Mint 100 NFT per month to receive monthly cap of 100 shares 
- Mint 10 NFT per month to receive monthly cap of 100 shares 

*Monthly distribution - 100 shares*

**Builders**
Those contributing by building and systemizing Mol’s infrastructure, including, Moloch v2x upgrades, UI/UX, research on new economic and legal models, community building, etc., will receive 100 shares monthly. Please see the Roadmap section for more on Mol's infrastructure.

*Monthly distribution - 100 shares*

**Initial Contributors**
To reward initial members for jumpstarting Mol, each initial contributor will receive a one-time lump sum of 100 shares.

*One time distribution - 100 shares*
