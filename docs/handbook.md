Mol LeArt is a DAO managed creative commons.

## Motivation
Humans are creative creatures. We use our brains to dream up fantastical and impossible things. Artists bring these things to life. This looks like paintings, music, writing, and more. Many of our favorite stories and memories are because of art. We love these things so much we’re willing to pay for them, sometimes at tremendous valuations.

The problem is, art has traditionally been gatekept by middlemen like galleries and brokers with little to no transparency when art gets sold and resold. As a result, when art is sold at higher and higher multiples, artists don’t get a piece of those profits. The phrase “starving artist” is a stereotype that is often associated with creatives but it doesn’t have to be this way.

With LexArt, an NFT token standard that Mol uses, artists can tokenize their work and retain a number of controls to how the token is used, even after the token is sold. Our goal is to expand the set of controls available to artists so that they no longer need to rely on third parties to engage in commercial activities. Like putting a pilot in the cockpit with different switches and knobs for controlling the direction of an aircraft, LexArt puts the power back in the hands of the artists.

## Governance

**Organization**

Mol is currently organized using Moloch v2 on xDAI. For a complete list of members, please see [Mol's Pokemol](https://xdai.pokemol.com/dao/0x905def314a0999df58960486ab4d7048dee53f8f/). 

Members should regularly vote on proposals related to:
- Membership 
- Mol's fee from primary and secondary sales 

**DAO Shares**

For monthly distribution of DAO shares, Mol will submit proposals on the first day of each month to reward those that made contributions the month before. 


## Roles
**Artist**

Artists contribute to the creative commons by minting and experimenting with DAO NFTs. Each member gets a factory by default to mint whatever she wants, except for content not protected under freedom of speech. Any new factory request requires members to submit a proposal for voting. 

Each mint rewards governance token, up to a monthly cap of 100 shares. Some options to calculating exchange rate could be:
- Mint 100 NFT per month to receive monthly cap of 100 shares 
- Mint 10 NFT per month to receive monthly cap of 100 shares 

*Monthly distribution - 100 shares*

**Builder**

Builders contribute to the creative commons by building out the infrastructure that supports the commons. Please see the Roadmap section for more on Mol's infrastructure.

*Monthly distribution - 100 shares*

**Community**

The role of a Community is to support and shill the commons. 

**Initial Contributors**

To reward initial members for jumpstarting Mol, each initial contributor will receive a one-time lump sum of 100 shares.

*One time distribution - 100 shares*
